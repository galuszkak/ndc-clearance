The following scenarios are included:\nChanges in the PaymentStatusCode of a payment transaction which was “PENDING“, following an Offline payment (through redirection) Changes to a passenger’s name and contact details made directly with the Airline Changes to the departure time of a flight segment (minor delay). Changes to a flight number for the same date/time of departure Planned changes to a flight itinerary, including Seller follow-up actions Cancellation of a flight (service disruption) with no re-accomodation Changes to aircraft type and operating carrier\nWith any use of the OrderChangeNotifRQ message, the technical consideration to observe at all times is the minimalist use of data elements, including only elements whose values have changed, and the necessary IDs that define the location of the elements. Any element whose data has not changed between two versions of an Order should be excluded from the message.\nFile Modified Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025A - Payment Status.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025B - Name & Contact Details.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025C - Segment Time Change.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025D - Flight Number Change.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025E - Itinerary Change.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025F - Flight Cancellation (No Reaccomodation).xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Labels No labels Preview View XML File EXM_ORD_025G - Aircraft Type and Operating Carrier Change.xml 15 Apr 2024 by Mladenka Vukmirovic Download All",
